# 🌞 Solar Tracking System

This project is a simple **Solar Tracking System** designed using Arduino UNO, servo motors, a solar panel, LDRs, and basic cardboard structure. The goal of this system is to **automatically adjust the position of the solar panel to face the direction of maximum sunlight**, improving the efficiency of solar energy collection.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **LDRs** are placed on four corners of the solar panel to sense light intensity from different directions.
2. Arduino reads the analog values from the LDRs.
3. It calculates which direction has the most sunlight.
4. According to the calculation, Arduino adjusts the position of the panel by controlling the servo motors.
5. This allows the solar panel to always face the brightest direction of the sun.
